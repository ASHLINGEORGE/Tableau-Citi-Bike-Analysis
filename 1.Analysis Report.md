Classic bikes, totaling 1,481,291 rides, have been extensively utilized within the Citi Bike system. These traditional pedal-powered bicycles are favored by many users for their simplicity and accessibility, making them ideal for short-distance trips, commuting, and leisure rides around the city.

Electric bikes have also seen substantial usage, with a total of 393,136 rides. Offering an additional level of convenience and speed compared to classic bikes, electric bikes are popular among users seeking a faster and more effortless riding experience. They are often preferred for longer-distance trips, hilly terrains, and for users seeking assistance with pedaling.

Despite being a smaller segment, docked bikes have garnered 9,909 rides within the Citi Bike system. These traditional bicycles are parked and locked at designated docking stations after each use. While docked bikes may be less prevalent than their dockless counterparts, they still cater to users who prefer the reliability and predictability of docking stations, especially for longer rides or commuting purposes.
